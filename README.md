# Bop-It-Game-Rework
As part of the experimental games module during second year of university, we got in teams and had to make a game that was experimental in some way, be it in gameplay or control scheme. 

For our experimental project we came up with the idea of turning the classic toy 'Bop It' into a controller for a game. 

We started off by getting our hands on a bop it and then taking the inner circuitry out and replacing it with a raspberry pi pico. The pico was then programmed using a short python script to emulate keyboard input when the buttons from the bop it are pressed. The casing of the bop it was then reattatched .
